# üì¶ Raycast Script: Installed Apps Summary

This Raycast script lists all installed macOS apps, copies the names to your clipboard, and shows a notification summarizing how many were installed in the current and previous year.

## üí° Why This Is Useful

Ever find yourself wondering *‚ÄúDo I already have an app installed that can do this?‚Äù*

I use this script when I need to do something like:
- Batch rename files  
- Convert videos to audio  
- Extract text from PDFs  
- Or do any random task I think I might already have an app for (but can't remember)...

Instead of digging through Finder, I run this script to generate a full list of my installed apps ‚Äî it gets copied to the clipboard instantly. Then I paste that list into ChatGPT and ask:

> ‚ÄúWhich of these apps can [do the task]?‚Äù

It‚Äôs a great way to rediscover what‚Äôs already on your system and avoid unnecessary downloads.

folders=("/Applications" "$HOME/Applications")
year_now=$(date +%Y)
year_prev=$((year_now - 1))

count_now=0
count_prev=0

# Find and sort app names
all_apps=$(find "${folders[@]}" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.app")
app_names=$(echo "$all_apps" | sed 's:.*/::; s:.app$::' | sort)
echo "$app_names" | pbcopy
total_count=$(echo "$app_names" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')

# Count apps by year
while IFS= read -r app; do
  mod_year=$(date -r "$(stat -f "%m" "$app")" +%Y)
  [[ "$mod_year" == "$year_now" ]] && ((count_now++))
  [[ "$mod_year" == "$year_prev" ]] && ((count_prev++))
done <<< "$all_apps"

# Show notification
message="${total_count} total apps
üìÜ Installed in $year_now: $count_now
üìÜ Installed in $year_prev: $count_prev"

osascript -e "display notification \"$message\" with title \"Raycast: Apps copied\" sound name \"Glass\""
